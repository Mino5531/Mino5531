### Hi there (〃▽〃)
I'm currenly working on my own 2D mmorpg called magica online (๑˃ᴗ˂)ﻭ .
Just a little heads up. You might see in my stats that I worked on a lot of web stuff... that was for school. I had to use php and javascript and so on. I'm not a frontend and or a web dev and my website designs look bad. (っ´ω\`)ﾉ(╥ω╥)
